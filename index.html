          <h1>What happens when a rich Chinese tech bro looks for love online</h1>
          
            <p>A wealthy Chinese tech bro has stirred up a hornet’s nest with a brutally honest online ad looking for love.
Actually, he doesn’t talk about love at all. Instead, he lists his salary, job, education, financial assets and family background and gives a detailed description of the kind of woman he is looking for. </p>
            <p>The ad was posted on the Twitter-like Weibo last week by an online influencer, Beijing Big Potato, on behalf of the man, who says he’s an employee at tech giant Alibaba.
Inkstone, which is also owned by Alibaba, was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the viral ad, but it appears to be a genuine window into how marriage, money, childbearing, gender roles, heightism and the rural-urban divide are viewed in China today. </p>
<p>In 2018, China's disposable income per capita was $9,700. In Beijing, the average annual income per person was $13,000. So, $240,000 is a very high income in China and, well, everywhere.
 [$240,000], still have room to move up, home in the Beiyuan district</p>
          <p>Phoenix men refer to men who come from humble beginnings but make it to the middle or upper classes through hard work, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Under China’s patriarchal tradition, men are often expected to support their poorer extended families. Many wealthy urban women are reluctant to date phoenix men because of these financial obligations to the extended family.</p>
          <p>The coastal provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are both near the man's hometown in Anhui. But the two regions are much wealthier than Anhui. People from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are believed to be richer and better educated.
, can consider Anhui, gentle and kind personality, book smart and street smart, cute and pretty appearance, nice body, not shorter than 162 cm tall</p>
          <p>After the one-child policy was abolished in 2016, Chinese couples are allowed to have a maximum of two children. But many urban women nowadays only want one child, and it's not unusual for them to refuse to have any children.
, these are my authentic requirements, does everyone think this is promising?</p>
